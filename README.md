## Review

![Look at this lovely design](https://github.com/ollaweb/vue3-notes/blob/main/ToDo-List.jpg)

### Description

Small, very simple project created by learning Vue 3 [in this course.](https://tocode.ru/courses/vuejs-3-s-nulya-do-rezultata/)

## I added a few additional features to this application to make it look more completeüßê

#### In this project:

- adding Vue 3 via CDN link;
- using options API;
- save/get data from LocalStorage;
- adding new tasks;
- delete tasks in the list;
- my additions:
  -- editing tasks in the list;
  -- mark tasks in the list as done;
  -- hide done tasks;
  -- information about all tasks and tasks that are already done;
  -- delete only done tasks;
  -- delete all tasks;
